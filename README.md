# mubsan

Minimal implementation of UBSAN, which can be utilized inside kernels.

## Note

**I understand some of the code is a bit repetitive and an eyesore, I'm currently thinking of ways to reduce the repetitive nature of the code, while also making sure it doesn't over complicated it**

This isn't complete yet, however if you want to test it, fork the repository and run:

```bash
$ make
```

## Usage

Statically link the `mubsan.c` file with your existing project.  
Then, define a function with the following signature:

```c
int mubsan_log(const char* format, ...) {
    // code
}
```

This function should accepting a formatted string and print it to the screen, however, how you implement it is up to you.

Running the test with the aforementioned instructions will yield this output, then exit:

```
mubsan @ line 21, column 8, file test.c: array out of bounds, for type 'int [4]', by index type 'int' 4
```

## Credit

So, finding documentation for this was pretty abysmal, so I had to utilize other implementations and using them as reference.  
However, the only main reference I even used was GCC itself, however, I'll credit the others that I viewed anyways.
